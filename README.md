🌟 Project Showcase: Comprehensive Data Visualization for Credit Card Transactions 🌟

I’m thrilled to share my latest project, where I harnessed the power of Power BI, SQL, and Excel to create insightful dashboards for a Credit Card Transaction Report and a Credit Card Customer Report.

🔍 Objective:
Analyze credit card transaction data to produce dashboards that enhance business strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

🛠️ Steps Involved:
➡ Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.
Corrected data types.
Added columns such as age group, total revenue, and salary group for detailed analysis.
➡ Data Loading:

Loaded the dataset into MySQL Server.
Connected MySQL Server to Power BI for real-time data synchronization.
➡ Data Analysis:

Utilized DAX functions, including SWITCH, CALCULATE, WEEKNUM(), and other time intelligence functions for robust data analysis and reporting.
💡 Key Insights:

Revenue: Decreased by 13.4% from week 51 to 52; total $55.3M till week 52.
Financials: $7.8M interest earned; $44.5M total transactions.
User Insights: Most frequent users aged 40-50; swiping most preferred.
Satisfaction: Score of 3.19.
Revenue by Gender: Males $30M, Females $25M.
Card Usage: 93% transactions with blue and silver cards.
Top States: Texas, New York, California contribute 68% of revenue.
Activation Rate: 57.5%
Delinquency Rate: 6.07%
🔥 Recommendations:

Implement targeted marketing campaigns for the 40-50 age group to increase usage.
Promote swiping benefits to enhance customer satisfaction.
Focus on regions with lower revenue contributions to diversify income sources.
Introduce initiatives to reduce the delinquency rate and improve overall credit health.
Enhance features and rewards for blue and silver credit card holders to maintain their dominance.
